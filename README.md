# Project Structure
The incremental service project is divided into three main parts:
   - The first part, named the "Cluster" folder, provides a comprehensive guide on setting up a Kubernetes cluster using Vagrant and VirtualBox.
    It offers a step-by-step description of how to replicate the cluster used in our experiments on your local computer.
   - The second part, known as the "GAG Service Engine," includes the source code for the service execution engine.
     This engine is based on the model of guarded attributed grammars, which forms the foundation of its functionality.
   - The last part consists of an example of a merge sort incremental service specification.
     It includes YAML files and Java source code for the guards and local computations used in the specification.
